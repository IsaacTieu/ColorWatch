## üì• Instructions

### First Screen

- `Camera Index`: Specifies the camera to be accessed.  
  Example: `1` for the first camera. For an external webcam, it is typically `1`.

- `Time Elapsed per Color Check (seconds)`: Specifies the rate in seconds at which pictures are saved.  
  Example: `3` for a picture saved every 3 seconds.

- `Warning Sign Length (frames)`: Duration of a warning sign being displayed on screen in frames.  
  Example: `30` for a message to be displayed for 30 frames. For a 30 frames per second webcam, this would result in the warning sign lasting for 1 second.

- `Webhook URL`: Specifies the webhook to send Microsoft Teams notifications to.  
  Example: `false` for no Microsoft Teams message to be sent.

- `Select Region of Interest (ROI)`: Press this button to select a ROI. This can be done by holding down left click on the mouse and dragging across the screen.

### Second Screen

- `(R/G/B) Value Change`: This represents the R/G/B value change to be detected for each value. These values range from 0-255, so smaller values will detect smaller changes.  
  Example: `256' for no R/G/B value change to be detected.

- `Start Live Monitoring`: Press this button to start the live monitoring.

### Third Screen

- `Save Files`: Press this button to initiate file saving. `.csv` files will be exported containing R/G/B values and time data. A video of the session will be exported as a `.mp4` file.
